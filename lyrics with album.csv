Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him,reputation
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted,reputation
"But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom",reputation
Holdin' him for ransom,reputation
"Some, some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though",reputation
"Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so",reputation
"I see nothing better, I keep him forever",reputation
Like a vendetta-ta,reputation
"I, I, I see how this is gon' go",reputation
Touch me and you'll never be alone,reputation
"I, island breeze and lights down low",reputation
No one has to know,reputation
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams",reputation
"You should see the things we do, baby, mmm",reputation
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams",reputation
"I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time",reputation
Are you ready for it?,reputation
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me,reputation
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry,reputation
"But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and",reputation
"We'll move to an island, and",reputation
And he can be my jailer,reputation
Burton to this Taylor,reputation
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure,reputation
I forget their names now,reputation
I'm so very tame now,reputation
"Never be the same now, now",reputation
"I, I, I see how this is gon' go",reputation
Touch me and you'll never be alone,reputation
"I, island breeze and lights down low",reputation
No one has to know (No one has to know),reputation

Are you ready for it? (Oh),reputation
Are you ready for it?,reputation
"Baby, let the games begin",reputation
Let the games begin,reputation
Let the games begin,reputation
"Baby, let the games begin",reputation

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters,red
"And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh",red
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight,red
"To fall in love with strangers, uh uh uh uh",red
Yeaaaah,red
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time,red
"It's miserable and magical, oh-yeah",red
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines,red
"It's time, uh uh",red
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22,red
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you,red
You don't know about me but I bet you want to,red
"Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22",red
It seems like one of those nights,red
This place is too crowded too many cool kids,red
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ugh),red
It seems like one of those nights,red
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping,red
Yeaaaah,red
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way,red

We were both young when I first saw you,fearless
I close my eyes & the flashback starts,fearless
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air,fearless
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns",fearless
See you make your way through the crowd,fearless
"And say ""Hello"", little did I know...",fearless
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles",fearless
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""",fearless
And I was crying on the staircase,fearless
"Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...",fearless
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",fearless
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run,fearless
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess,fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",fearless
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,fearless
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew,fearless
"So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while",fearless
"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter",fearless
"And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""",fearless
But you were everything to me,fearless
"I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...",fearless
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",fearless
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run,fearless
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess,fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",fearless
"Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel",fearless
This love is difficult but it's real,fearless
"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess",fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",fearless
...,fearless
I got tired of waiting,fearless
Wondering if you were ever coming around,fearless
My faith in you was fading,fearless
When I met you on the outskirts of town,fearless
And I said...,fearless
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone",fearless
I keep waiting for you but you never come,fearless
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,fearless
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said,fearless
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone",fearless
I love you & that's all I really know,fearless
"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress",fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",fearless
Oh oh oh,fearless
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you,fearless
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?,taylor swift

Why would you wanna make the very first scar?,taylor swift
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?,taylor swift
"Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall",taylor swift
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall,taylor swift

So don't ask me,taylor swift
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out,taylor swift
Don't know what's down this road,taylor swift

"I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue",lover
Put you in jail for something you didn't do,lover
"I pinned your hands behind your back, oh",lover
"Thought I had reason to attack, but no",lover
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves,lover
"Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us",lover
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?,lover
"It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say",lover
"Hey, it's all me, in my head",lover
I'm the one who burned us down,lover
But it's not what I meant,lover
Sorry that I hurt you,lover
"I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)",lover
"I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)",lover
"I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go",lover
Meet me in the afterglow,lover
It's so excruciating to see you low,lover
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go,lover
This ultraviolet morning light below,lover
"Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh",lover
"I lived like an island, punished you in silence",lover
"Went off like sirens, just crying",lover
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?,lover
"It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say",lover
"Hey, it's all me, in my head",lover
I'm the one who burned us down,lover

Meet me in the afterglow,lover
Tell me that you're still mine,lover
Tell me that we'll be just fine,lover
Even when I lose my mind,lover
I need to say,lover
Tell me that it's not my fault,lover
Tell me that I'm all you want,lover
Even when I break your heart,lover
I need to say,lover

I walked through the door with you the air was cold,red
But something about it felt like home somehow,red
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,red
"And you still got it in your drawer, even now",red
"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze",red
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate,red
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,red
And I can picture it after all these days,red
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more,red
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all,red
'Cause there we are again on that little town street,red
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me,red
"Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well",red
Photo album on the counter,red
Your cheeks were turning red,red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,red
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team,red
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me,red
And I know it's long gone and,red
there was nothing else I could do,red
And I forget about you long enough,red
to forget why I needed to,red
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,red
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,red
"Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all to well",red
Yeah,red
And maybe we got lost in translation,red
Maybe I asked for too much,red
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,red
'til you tore it all up,red
"Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well",red
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,red
So casually cruel in the name of being honest,red
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,red
"'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well",red
"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it",red
I'd like to be my old self again,red
but I'm still trying to find it,red
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,red
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,red
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,red
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,red
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well,red
Yeah,red
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,red
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,red
"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",red
"Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all",red
"Down the stairs, you were there, 'cause you remember it all",red
"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",red
People like you always want back the love they gave away,1989
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed,1989
The more I think about it now,1989
The less I know,1989
All I know is that you drove us off the road,1989
Stay,1989

I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made,1989
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside,1989
But people like me are gone forever,1989
When you say goodbye,1989

"He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do",red
Turned the lock & put my headphones on,red
He always said he didn't get this song but I do,red
I do,red
Walked in expecting you'd be late,red
But you got here early & you stand & wave,red
I walk to you,red
You pulled my chair out & helped me in,red
And you don't know how nice that is,red
But I do,red
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,red
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did,red
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does,red
Is break & burn & end,red
But on a Wednesday in a café,red
I watched it begin again,red
...,red
You said you never met one girl who had as many James Taylor records as you,red
But I do,red
We tell stories & you don't know why,red
I'm coming off a little shy,red
But I do,red
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,red

And I almost brought him up,red
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches,red
every single Christmas & I won't talk about that,red
"And for the first time, what's past is past",red
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,red
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did,red

You're on the phone with your girlfriend—she's upset,fearless
She's going off about something that you said,fearless
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.,fearless
"I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.",fearless
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.,fearless
And she'll never know your story like I do,fearless
But she wears short skirts,fearless
I wear t-shirt,fearless
She's cheer captain,fearless

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans,fearless
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.,fearless
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,fearless
"""Hey, isn't this easy?""",fearless
And you've got a smile,fearless
That can light up this whole town,fearless
I haven't seen it in awhile,fearless
Since she brought you down.,fearless
You say you're fine—I know you better than that,fearless
"Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?",fearless
She wears high heels,fearless
I wear sneakers,fearless
She's cheer captain,fearless

You belong with me,fearless
You belong with me,fearless

In the middle of the night,fearless

When you know you're 'bout to cry,fearless
I know your favorite songs,fearless
And you tell me about your dreams,fearless
Think I know where you belong,fearless
Think I know it's with me,fearless
Can't you se that I'm the one,fearless
Who understands you?,fearless

She's better known for the things that she does,speak now

On the playground won't make you many friends,speak now
"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",speak now
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha",speak now
...,speak now
She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list,speak now
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it,speak now
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling,speak now
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things but,speak now
Sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,speak now
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,speak now
"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me",speak now
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity,speak now

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,speak now
"'Cause I don't think you do, oh",speak now
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,speak now
"I don't think you do, I don't think you do",speak now
Let's hear the applause,speak now
C'mon show me how much better you are,speak now

Saw you there and I thought,1989

"So hey, let's be friends",1989
I'm dying to see how this one ends,1989
Grab your passport and my hand,1989
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend,1989
So it's gonna be forever,1989
Or it's gonna go down in flames,1989
You can tell me when it's over,1989
If the high was worth the pain,1989
Got a long list of ex-lovers,1989

Got a long list of ex-lovers,1989
They'll tell you I'm insane,1989
"But I've got a blank space, baby",1989
And I'll write your name,1989
"Cherry lips, crystal skies",1989
I could show you incredible things,1989
"Stolen kisses, pretty lies",1989
"You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen",1989
Find out what you want,1989
Be that girl for a month,1989
"Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no",1989
"Screaming, crying, perfect storms",1989
I can make all the tables turn,1989
Rose garden filled with thorns,1989
Keep you second guessing like,1989
"""Oh, my God, who is she?""",1989
I get drunk on jealousy,1989
But you'll come back each time you leave,1989
"'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream",1989
So it's gonna be forever,1989
Or it's gonna go down in flames,1989

Breathe,fearless

And when I fell hard you took a step back,red

And he's long gone when he's next to me,red
And I realize the blame is on me,red
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in,red

Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why,red
"You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning",red
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street,red
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be,red
"And now I see, now I see, now I see",red
He was long gone when he met me,red

The drought was the very worst,1989
"(Ahh, ahh)",1989
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst,1989
"It was months, and months of back and forth",1989
"(Ahh, ahh)",1989
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore,1989

And by morning,1989
Gone was any trace of you,1989
I think I am finally clean,1989
There was nothing left to do,1989
"(Ahh, ahh)",1989
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room,1989
So I punched a hole in the roof,1989
"(Ahh, ahh)",1989
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you,1989
The water filled my lungs,1989
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing,1989
The rain came pouring down when I was drowning,1989

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you,lover
And I snuck in through the garden gate,lover
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh),lover

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets,reputation
Picture of your face in an invisible locket,reputation
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it,reputation
I had a bad feeling,reputation
"And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis",reputation
"People started talking, putting us through our paces",reputation
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it,reputation
I had a bad feeling,reputation

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in,lover
Everyone looked worse in the light,lover
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven,lover
"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye",lover
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,lover
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you,lover
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night,lover
"And now I see daylight, I only see daylight",lover
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky,lover
And so I became the butt of the joke,lover
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked,lover
"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke",lover
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down,lover
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town,lover
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now,lover
"It's brighter now, now",lover
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,lover

And I can still see it all (In my mind),lover
"All of you, all of me (Intertwined)",lover
I once believed love would be (Black and white),lover
But it's golden (Golden),lover
And I can still see it all (In my head),lover
Back and forth from New York (Singing in your bed),lover
I once believed love would be (Burning red),lover
But it's golden,lover
"Like daylight, like daylight",lover
"Like daylight, daylight",lover
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,lover

Like daylight,lover
It's golden like daylight,lover
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go,lover
"Just let it go, let it go",lover
I wanna be defined by the things that I love,lover
Not the things I hate,lover
"Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of",lover
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night,lover
"I, I just think that",lover
You are what you love,lover
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you,speak now
"Counting my footsteps, praying the floor wont fall through, again",speak now
"My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine",speak now
You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain,speak now
"When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day",speak now
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight,speak now
"Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why",speak now
Dear John,speak now
I see it all now that you're gone,speak now
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,speak now
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home,speak now
I should've known,speak now
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame,speak now
Or maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away,speak now
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand,speak now
"And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can",speak now
Dear John,speak now

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,speak now
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home,speak now
Dear John,speak now

Don't you think nineteen's too young,speak now
To be played by your dark twisted games?,speak now
When I loved you so,speak now
I should've known,speak now
You are an expert at sorry,speak now
And keeping lines blurry,speak now
Never impressed by me acing your tests,speak now
All the girls that you run dry,speak now
Have dried lifeless eyes,speak now
Cause you burned them out,speak now
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,speak now
So don't look now,speak now
I'm shining like fireworks,speak now
Over your sad empty town,speak now
Dear John,speak now
I see it all now that you're gone,speak now
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,speak now
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home,speak now
I see it all now that you're gone,speak now
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,speak now

Paper cut stains from my paper-thin plans,lover

I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do,reputation
"I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be",reputation
Drinking on a beach with you all over me,reputation
"I know what they all say, yeah, but I ain't tryna play",reputation
I wanna be your end game,reputation
I wanna be your first string,reputation
I wanna be your A-Team,reputation

Just a flesh wound,folklore
Here's your rifle,folklore
Crawling up the beaches now,folklore

"With you, I serve",folklore
"With you, I fall down",folklore
Down,folklore
Watch you breathin',folklore
Watch you breathin' out,folklore
Out,folklore
Something med school,folklore
Did not cover,folklore
Someone's daughter,folklore
Someone's mother,folklore
Holds your hand through plastic now,folklore
"Doc, I think she's crashin' out",folklore
And some things you just can't speak about,folklore
Only twenty minutes to sleep,folklore
But you dream of some epiphany,folklore
Just one single glimpse of relief,folklore
To make some sense of what you've seen,folklore
"With you, I serve",folklore
"With you, I fall down",folklore
Down (Down),folklore
Watch you breathin',folklore
Watch you breathin' out,folklore

"I can see you standing, honey",folklore
With his arms around your body,folklore
"Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all",folklore
And it took you five whole minutes,folklore
To pack us up and leave me with it,folklore
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall,folklore
I think I've seen this film before,folklore
And I didn't like the ending,folklore
You're not my homeland anymore,folklore

So who am I offending now?,folklore
"You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out",folklore
I think I've seen this film before,folklore

"So step right out, there is no amount",folklore
Of crying I can do for you,folklore
All this time,folklore
We always walked a very thin line,folklore
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out),folklore
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs),folklore
All this time,folklore
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind),folklore
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around),folklore
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs),folklore
"So many signs, so many signs",folklore
You didn't even see the signs,folklore
