Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him,pop,reputation
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted,pop,reputation

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry,pop,reputation
"But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and",pop,reputation
"We'll move to an island, and",pop,reputation
And he can be my jailer,pop,reputation
Burton to this Taylor,pop,reputation

We were both young when I first saw you,country,fearless
I close my eyes & the flashback starts,country,fearless
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air,country,fearless
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns",country,fearless
See you make your way through the crowd,country,fearless
"And say ""Hello"", little did I know...",country,fearless
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles",country,fearless
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""",country,fearless
And I was crying on the staircase,country,fearless
"Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...",country,fearless
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",country,fearless
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run,country,fearless
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess,country,fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",country,fearless
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,country,fearless
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew,country,fearless
"So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while",country,fearless
"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter",country,fearless
"And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""",country,fearless
But you were everything to me,country,fearless
"I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...",country,fearless
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",country,fearless
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run,country,fearless
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess,country,fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",country,fearless
"Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel",country,fearless
This love is difficult but it's real,country,fearless
"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess",country,fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",country,fearless
...,country,fearless
I got tired of waiting,country,fearless
Wondering if you were ever coming around,country,fearless
My faith in you was fading,country,fearless
When I met you on the outskirts of town,country,fearless
And I said...,country,fearless
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone",country,fearless
I keep waiting for you but you never come,country,fearless
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,country,fearless
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said,country,fearless
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone",country,fearless
I love you & that's all I really know,country,fearless
"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress",country,fearless
"It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""",country,fearless
Oh oh oh,country,fearless
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you,country,fearless

I walked through the door with you the air was cold,,red
But something about it felt like home somehow,,red
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,,red
"And you still got it in your drawer, even now",,red
"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze",,red
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate,,red
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,,red
And I can picture it after all these days,,red
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more,,red
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all,,red
'Cause there we are again on that little town street,,red
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me,,red
"Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well",,red
Photo album on the counter,,red
Your cheeks were turning red,,red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,,red
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team,,red
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me,,red
And I know it's long gone and,,red
there was nothing else I could do,,red
And I forget about you long enough,,red
to forget why I needed to,,red
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,,red
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,,red
"Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all to well",,red
Yeah,,red
And maybe we got lost in translation,,red
Maybe I asked for too much,,red
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,,red
'til you tore it all up,,red
"Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well",,red
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,,red
So casually cruel in the name of being honest,,red
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,,red
"'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well",,red
"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it",,red
I'd like to be my old self again,,red
but I'm still trying to find it,,red
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,,red
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,,red
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,,red
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,,red
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well,,red
Yeah,,red
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,,red
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,,red
"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",,red
"Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all",,red
"Down the stairs, you were there, 'cause you remember it all",,red
"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",,red

He always said he didn't get this song but I do,,red

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,,red

But on a Wednesday in a café,,red
I watched it begin again,,red

You said you never met one girl who had as many James Taylor records as you,,red

You're on the phone with your girlfriend—she's upset,country,fearless
She's going off about something that you said,country,fearless
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.,country,fearless
"I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.",country,fearless
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.,country,fearless
And she'll never know your story like I do,country,fearless
But she wears short skirts,country,fearless
I wear t-shirt,country,fearless
She's cheer captain,country,fearless
And I'm on the bleachers,country,fearless
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find,country,fearless
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.,country,fearless
If you could see,country,fearless

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans,country,fearless
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.,country,fearless
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,country,fearless
"""Hey, isn't this easy?""",country,fearless
And you've got a smile,country,fearless
That can light up this whole town,country,fearless
I haven't seen it in awhile,country,fearless
Since she brought you down.,country,fearless
You say you're fine—I know you better than that,country,fearless
"Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?",country,fearless
She wears high heels,country,fearless
I wear sneakers,country,fearless
She's cheer captain,country,fearless
And I'm on the bleachers,country,fearless
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find,country,fearless

When you know you're 'bout to cry,country,fearless
I know your favorite songs,country,fearless
And you tell me about your dreams,country,fearless

Time for a little revenge,country,speak now
...,country,speak now
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer,country,speak now
"And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him",country,speak now
"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause",country,speak now
She took him faster than you can say sabotage,country,speak now
"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it",country,speak now
I underestimated just who I was dealing with,country,speak now
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum,country,speak now
She underestimated just who she was stealing from,country,speak now
...,country,speak now
"She's not a saint, and she's not what you think",country,speak now
"She's an actress, whoa",country,speak now
She's better known for the things that she does,country,speak now
"On the mattress, whoa",country,speak now
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,country,speak now
On the playground won't make you many friends,country,speak now
"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",country,speak now
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha",country,speak now
...,country,speak now
She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list,country,speak now
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it,country,speak now
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling,country,speak now
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things but,country,speak now
Sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,country,speak now
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,country,speak now
"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me",country,speak now
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity,country,speak now
...,country,speak now
"She's not a saint, and she's not what you think",country,speak now
"She's an actress, whoa",country,speak now
She's better known for the things that she does,country,speak now

"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha",country,speak now
...,country,speak now
"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey",country,speak now
"You might have him, but haven't you heard?",country,speak now
"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey",country,speak now
"You might have him, but I always get the last word",country,speak now
Woah,country,speak now

...,country,speak now
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,country,speak now
"'Cause I don't think you do, oh",country,speak now
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,country,speak now
"I don't think you do, I don't think you do",country,speak now
Let's hear the applause,country,speak now
C'mon show me how much better you are,country,speak now
See you deserve some applause,country,speak now
'Cause you're so much better,country,speak now
She took him faster than you can say sabotage,country,speak now

Just walk away,country,taylor swift
No use defending words that you will never say,country,taylor swift
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,country,taylor swift
I've never been anywhere cold as you,country,taylor swift
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray,country,taylor swift
And I stood there loving you and washed them all away,country,taylor swift
And you come away with a great little story,country,taylor swift
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you,country,taylor swift
"Oh, what a shame",country,taylor swift

You said it in a simple way,,red
"4 AM, the second day",,red
How strange that I don't know you at all,,red

One last kiss then catch your flight,,red
Right when I was just about to fall,,red

"Come back, be here",,red
I guess you're in New York today,,red
I don't wanna need you this way,,red
"Come back, be here",,red
The delicate beginning rush,,red
The feeling you can know so much,,red
Without knowing anything at all,,red
And now that I can put this down,,red
If I had known what I'd known now,,red
I never would have played so nonchalant,,red
Taxi cabs and busy streets,,red
That never bring you back to me,,red
I can't help but wish you took me with you,,red
And this is when the feeling sinks in,,red
I don't wanna miss you like this,,red
"Come back, be here",,red
I guess you're in London today,,red
And I don't wanna need you this way,,red
"Come back, be here",,red
This is falling in love in the cruelest way,,red
This is falling for you & you are worlds away,,red
"New York, be here",,red
But you're in London & I break down,,red
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around,,red
This is when the feeling sinks in,,red

We were in the backseat,pop,lover
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar,pop,lover
"""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""",pop,lover
I said casually in the car,pop,lover
We were a fresh page on the desk,pop,lover
Filling in the blanks as we go,pop,lover
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head,pop,lover
Leading us home,pop,lover
"I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends",pop,lover
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,pop,lover
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend,pop,lover
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,pop,lover
"And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name",pop,lover
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away",pop,lover
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,pop,lover
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,pop,lover
"Windows swung right open, autumn air",pop,lover
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours,pop,lover
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street,pop,lover
Memorize the creaks in the floor,pop,lover
"Back when we were card sharks, playing games",pop,lover
I thought you were leading me on,pop,lover
"I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street",pop,lover
Before you even knew I was gone,pop,lover
"But then you called, showed your hand",pop,lover
I turned around before I hit the tunnel,pop,lover
"Sat on the roof, you and I",pop,lover
"I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends",pop,lover

You hold my hand on the street,pop,lover
Walk me back to that apartment,pop,lover
"Years ago, we were just inside",pop,lover
Barefoot in the kitchen,pop,lover
Sacred new beginnings,pop,lover
"That became my religion, listen",pop,lover
I hope I never lose you,pop,lover
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,pop,lover
"Oh, never again",pop,lover

"""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""",pop,lover
I said casually in the car,pop,lover
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night,pop,lover
"You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",pop,lover
"Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price",pop,lover
"You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",pop,lover
"Killing me slow, out the window",pop,lover
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below,pop,lover
"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes",pop,lover
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more,pop,lover
"And it's new, the shape of your body",pop,lover
"It's blue, the feeling I've got",pop,lover
"And it's ooh, whoa oh",pop,lover
It's a cruel summer,pop,lover
"It's cool, that's what I tell 'em",pop,lover
"No rules, unbreakable heaven",pop,lover
"But ooh, whoa oh",pop,lover
It's a cruel summer,pop,lover
With you,pop,lover
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine,pop,lover
"I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",pop,lover
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times,pop,lover
"We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",pop,lover
"So cut the headlights, summer's a knife",pop,lover
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone,pop,lover
"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes",pop,lover
"And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know",pop,lover

It's a cruel summer,pop,lover
With you,pop,lover
I'm drunk in the back of the car,pop,lover
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh),pop,lover
"Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true",pop,lover
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you,pop,lover
And I snuck in through the garden gate,pop,lover
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh),pop,lover
And I screamed for whatever it's worth,pop,lover
"""I love you,"" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?",pop,lover
He looks so pretty like a devil,pop,lover

"My, my love had been frozen",pop,reputation
"Deep blue, but you painted me golden",pop,reputation
"Oh, and you held me close",pop,reputation
"Oh, how was I to know that",pop,reputation
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets,pop,reputation
Picture of your face in an invisible locket,pop,reputation
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it,pop,reputation
I had a bad feeling,pop,reputation
"And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis",pop,reputation
"People started talking, putting us through our paces",pop,reputation
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it,pop,reputation
I had a bad feeling,pop,reputation
But we were dancing,pop,reputation
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied",pop,reputation
"Yeah, we were dancing",pop,reputation

Deep fears that the world would divide us,pop,reputation
"So, baby, can we dance",pop,reputation
"Oh, through an avalanche?",pop,reputation
"And say, say that we got it",pop,reputation
"I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted",pop,reputation
"Oh, 'cause it's gravity",pop,reputation
"Oh, keeping you with me",pop,reputation

I'd kiss you as the lights went out,pop,reputation
Swaying as the room burned down,pop,reputation
I'd hold you as the water rushes in,pop,reputation
If I could dance with you again,pop,reputation

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in,pop,lover
Everyone looked worse in the light,pop,lover
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven,pop,lover
"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye",pop,lover
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,pop,lover
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you,pop,lover
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night,pop,lover
"And now I see daylight, I only see daylight",pop,lover
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky,pop,lover
And so I became the butt of the joke,pop,lover
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked,pop,lover
"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke",pop,lover
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down,pop,lover
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town,pop,lover
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now,pop,lover
"It's brighter now, now",pop,lover
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,pop,lover
(I can never look away),pop,lover
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you,pop,lover

"And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)",pop,lover
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",pop,lover
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",pop,lover
And I can still see it all (In my mind),pop,lover
"All of you, all of me (Intertwined)",pop,lover
I once believed love would be (Black and white),pop,lover
But it's golden (Golden),pop,lover
And I can still see it all (In my head),pop,lover
Back and forth from New York (Singing in your bed),pop,lover
I once believed love would be (Burning red),pop,lover
But it's golden,pop,lover
"Like daylight, like daylight",pop,lover
"Like daylight, daylight",pop,lover
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,pop,lover

"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",pop,lover
(I once believed love would be),pop,lover
Like daylight,pop,lover
It's golden like daylight,pop,lover
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go,pop,lover
"Just let it go, let it go",pop,lover
I wanna be defined by the things that I love,pop,lover
Not the things I hate,pop,lover
"Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of",pop,lover
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night,pop,lover
"I, I just think that",pop,lover
You are what you love,pop,lover
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you,country,speak now
"Counting my footsteps, praying the floor wont fall through, again",country,speak now
"My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine",country,speak now
You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain,country,speak now
"When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day",country,speak now
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight,country,speak now
"Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why",country,speak now
Dear John,country,speak now
I see it all now that you're gone,country,speak now
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,country,speak now
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home,country,speak now
I should've known,country,speak now
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame,country,speak now
Or maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away,country,speak now
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand,country,speak now
"And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can",country,speak now
Dear John,country,speak now

Don't you think nineteen's too young,country,speak now
To be played by your dark twisted games?,country,speak now
When I loved you so,country,speak now
I should've known,country,speak now
You are an expert at sorry,country,speak now
And keeping lines blurry,country,speak now
Never impressed by me acing your tests,country,speak now
All the girls that you run dry,country,speak now
Have dried lifeless eyes,country,speak now
Cause you burned them out,country,speak now
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,country,speak now
So don't look now,country,speak now
I'm shining like fireworks,country,speak now
Over your sad empty town,country,speak now
Dear John,country,speak now
I see it all now that you're gone,country,speak now
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,country,speak now

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,pop,lover
Flashbacks waking me up,pop,lover
"I get drunk, but it's not enough",pop,lover
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby,pop,lover
I look through the windows of this love,pop,lover
Even though we boarded them up,pop,lover
Chandelier still flickering here,pop,lover
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,pop,lover
It's death by a thousand cuts,pop,lover
"I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home",pop,lover
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright,pop,lover
"They say, ""I don't know""",pop,lover
And what once was ours is no one's now,pop,lover
"I see you everywhere, the only thing we share",pop,lover
Is this small town,pop,lover
"You said it was a great love, one for the ages",pop,lover
"But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?",pop,lover
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,pop,lover

"My heart, my hips, my body, my love",pop,lover
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch,pop,lover
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug,pop,lover
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club,pop,lover
"Our songs, our films, united, we stand",pop,lover
"Our country, guess it was a lawless land",pop,lover
Why are my fears at the touch of your hands?,pop,lover
Paper cut stains from my paper-thin plans,pop,lover
"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust",pop,lover
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up,pop,lover
"Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough",pop,lover
"But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts",pop,lover
"I get drunk, but it's not enough",pop,lover

"No, it's not",pop,lover
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch),pop,lover
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch,pop,lover

So you must like me for me,pop,reputation
"We can't make any promises now, can we babe?",pop,reputation
But you can make me a drink,pop,reputation
"Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?",pop,reputation
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black,pop,reputation
"Come here, you can meet me in the back",pop,reputation
"Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you",pop,reputation
"Oh damn, never seen that color blue",pop,reputation
Just think of the fun things we could do,pop,reputation
'Cause I like you,pop,reputation
